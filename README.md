# Discord V14+ bot Template

### HOW TO RUN

- Run the following commmand in terminal `npm install`
- Create a .env file in root directory.
- Add a `TOKEN="your discord app token"` to the env.
- If you are using vscode, try the f5 key to run the bot in debug mode.

### HOW TO ADD NEW COMMANDS

- All the commands go inside ./commands/[your category name]. Make sure that your commands follow this pattern as command files in the root folder will not be loaded.
